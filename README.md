# Hi, I'm Jaideep Chouhan 👋

### Robotics & Embedded Systems Engineer | Mechatronics | R&D Generalist

I build robots end-to-end — from **mechanical design** and **actuator control** to **embedded logic**, **communication systems**, and **autonomous behavior**.  
My focus is on **practical robotics**: systems that are reliable, efficient, and ready to work in real environments.

I enjoy working at the intersection of:
- **Mechanical Design**
- **Embedded Firmware**
- **Motion Control**
- **Wireless Communication**
- **Intelligent System Behavior**

### What I Work On

- **Legged robots** (Hexapods & Quadrupeds)
- **Tracked exploration & surveillance rovers**
- **Robotic arms** with precise motion capture & replay
- **Smart embedded systems** for sensing & automation
- **Wireless & Mesh Networks** (nRF24, ESP32, GSM, Wi-Fi)
- **Electromechanical design** in Blender & CAD tools

### Core Goal
My core mission is to make robotics **accessible, affordable, and practical** in real-world applications. I believe that impactful robotics does not always require expensive resources—what it truly needs is **smart design, modular engineering**, and a clear understanding of the **problem–solution–market fit**.

---

### Philosophy
Robotics should be **accessible, reliable, and purposeful**.  
We should engineer robotics systems that remain efficient, reliable, and upgrade-friendly even under resource constraints. Our work should focus on converting prototypes into scalable products that make advanced robotics more accessible and practical in real environments.
