>>> Hi, I'm **Jaideep Chouhan**

>>> Robotics Engineer | Embedded Systems | Mechatronics | R&D Generalist

I design and build robots from the ground up — from mechanical structure and actuator control to embedded logic, communication layers, and autonomous behaviors. I focus on practical, reliable, and resource-efficient robotics solutions that work in the real world.

My work spans:
- **Legged robots (Hexapods, Quadrupeds)**
- **Tracked surveillance & exploration rovers**
- **Robotic arms with playback and precise motion control**
- **AI + IoT-based smart monitoring and metering systems**
- **Wireless networking using nRF24 mesh, ESP32, Wi-Fi, GSM**

I lead my engineering work under the a cross functional robotics team "AIR Revolutionaries".
